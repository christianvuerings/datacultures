# API Key Generation

API keys are needed to access Canvas data. They cannot be publicly published, so each Data Cultures instance plus canvas instance must have the correct API keys generated.

An API key with teacher's permissions will be needed for the single course supported that uses the instance.

To create the proper API key:

    A. Log in as the instructor
    B. Go to the settings (follow the link in the upper right)
    C. At the bottom of the settings page, click "New Access Token"
    D. Follow the prompts, and don't place an expiration date (so the code won't stop working after that date)
    E. Save this generated token, it will be needed for the Canvas API calls.
